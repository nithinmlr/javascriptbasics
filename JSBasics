Variables ??
     Variables are containers to store any of the above datatypes.As a programmer you can assign a name to the value and it 
can be reused ,updated or tracked.
Creating a variable
var myName;
var a; //declaring the variable a
a =7;  //assigning the value 7 to the variable a
var b = 5;//assign number 5 to the variable b

//In JS using the escape Charector(\) you can skip the quotes not to consider part of the string
var myVar = " John once said,"\I love football\".";
//Arays are mutable
var myArray = [25,30,"myname"];
var myArrayElement = myArray[0];
